<a href="sec_math_as_language.html" class="permalink">¶</a><section class="introduction" id="introduction-3"><p id="p-34">In order for languages to work as means of communication, the people using them have to understand the basic rules of the language. You can think of this as the vocabulary and grammar of the language. If you get either of these wrong, then you might get some of your ideas across, but others may be lost.</p>
<p id="p-35">There's a bit of an issue with spoken languages though. Sometimes we don't convey the meaning that we want to. Think of the phrase:</p>
<p id="p-36">"Let's stop controlling people"</p>
<p id="p-37">Does that mean that we want to stop the people who are controlling, or does it mean that we want to stop controlling other people? Such a simply sentence and yet we really don't know what it means.</p>
<p id="p-38">Unless you understand Chinese, the following probably doesn't make much sense:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-1"><p id="p-39"><i class="foreign" lang="cn-CN">如果不知道规则，语言就没有意义</i></p></blockquote>
<p id="p-40">Without knowing the rules, language is meaningless...</p>
<p id="p-41">Mathematics is a language. It is a means of communicating ideas about the universe in a very very concrete way, and the rules that underpin it are even more strict than those of a regular spoken language. If you break the rules of the language of mathematics, then it all falls apart. Mathematics works so beautifully because if it is done correctly then the meaning that it conveys is completely unambiguous.</p>
<p id="p-42">In mathematics, if you're doing it right, then the ambiguities of a spoken language should never show up. For instance, we could say:</p>
<p id="p-43">"Let \(n\) be an even integer. This implies that \(n^2\) is also an even integer."</p>
<p id="p-44">This is a general statement about all even integers. We don't need any context. And in fact we can prove that it is true. When we do this there should be no ambiguity. We will see that it's not enough to find an example (ie. it's true for \(n=4\) so it's true for all even integers). We will see that we will have to have the definition of an even integer, and from there it will be very easy.</p>
<p id="p-45">In this case in fact we can prove it as follows:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-3"><p id="p-46">An even number is a number of the form \(2k\) where \(k\) is an integer, and vice versa, any number of the form \(2k\) is an even integer.</p></li>
<li id="li-4"><p id="p-47">Therefore, an even integer squared is always given by \((2k)^2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li id="li-5"><p id="p-48">This is the same as \(4k^2\) which can be written as \(2(2k^2)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li id="li-6"><p id="p-49">Any integer squared is also an integer, therefore \(k^2\) is an integer</p></li>
<li id="li-7"><p id="p-50">2 times any integer is also an integer, therefore \(2k^2\) is an integer</p></li>
<li id="li-8"><p id="p-51">Therefore \(2(2k^2)\) is 2 times an integer, and therefore this is an even integer by the first step. Thus an even integer squared is also an even integer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-52">We've done this in a more complicated way than we need perhaps, but we want to be completely explicit with what we're saying.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-17"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">2.1.1</span> <span class="title">The basic grammar of Mathematics</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-53">You've all been studying mathematics for at least ten years, right? In that time you went from being able to count, to basic arithmetic, to learning about trigonometry, and geometry, and algebra and many other subjects in between. But generally you don't get much of a chance to step back and look at the bigger picture of the machinery that you are using. In this chapter we want to talk about a few basic mathematical ideas, which are used everywhere in maths and unless you have a really deep understanding of them, what you can and can't do, and what it really means is actually not that clear. If you don't know these things, don't worry. It's really not taught in schools, even though most of these ideas are introduced. That seems really back to front, but then mathematics education in many ways is done in very strange ways. Let's first introduce some of these ideas that we want to define and understand in order to really be able to get much deeper into mathematics. This will involve going over things you thought you understood, as well as introducing many things that you have probably never heard about.</p>
<p id="p-54">So, these are some of the concepts that we want to discuss in this chapter:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-9"><p id="p-55">Definition</p></li>
<li id="li-10"><p id="p-56">Statement</p></li>
<li id="li-11"><p id="p-57">Equation</p></li>
<li id="li-12"><p id="p-58">Expression</p></li>
<li id="li-13"><p id="p-59">Identity</p></li>
<li id="li-14"><p id="p-60">Proof</p></li>
<li id="li-15"><p id="p-61">Property</p></li>
<li id="li-16"><p id="p-62">Axiom</p></li>
<li id="li-17"><p id="p-63">Operation</p></li>
<li id="li-18"><p id="p-64">Relation</p></li>
<li id="li-19"><p id="p-65">Variable</p></li>
<li id="li-20"><p id="p-66">Unknown</p></li>
<li id="li-21"><p id="p-67">Contradiction</p></li>
<li id="li-22"><p id="p-68">Theorem</p></li>
<li id="li-23"><p id="p-69">Lemma</p></li>
<li id="li-24"><p id="p-70">Corollary</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-71">As a first exercise, take your notebooks and write down what you think each one of these things is. It doesn't matter if you don't have a clue. For those that you've heard of, just write down anything that it brings to mind. Over the coming pages we will go through many of these in detail and hopefully give you a more precise understanding of them.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-18"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">2.1.2</span> <span class="title">The building blocks of the language</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-72">For any language, even without the vocabulary, there are rules about what you can and can't do. For instance in English a basic sentence structure is:</p>
<p id="p-73">"Subject+Verb+Adjective"</p>
<p id="p-74">Then, at least in terms of correct English you can put in any subject, verb and adjective, and even if it dosen't make logical sense, it's a perfectly good English sentence. For instance:</p>
<p id="p-75">"The sky is blue"</p>
<p id="p-76">One of the beautiful things about spoken language is that we are allowed to combine different sentence structures. For instance we can combine the "Subject+Verb+Adjective" with the "Subject+Verb+Object" and the "Subject+verb" patterns:</p>
<p id="p-77">"The book that is heavy sits on the lazy camel which is sleeping"</p>
<p id="p-78">In fact this so called recursion (putting one structure inside another) can happen in theory forever. That we are allowed to do these things are the basic rules of English.</p>
<p id="p-79">There is something similar in mathematics. The rules in the case of mathematics are those of Logic. Logic doesn't just mean something that makes sense. It is an entire subject and is the foundation of just about all of mathematics. It is the set of rules which allows us to learn one thing from another.</p>
<p id="p-80">Thankfully we are not going to do a lot of very Formal Logic, but it's useful to know the very basics. It's like knowing what we can do in English.</p>
<p id="p-81">We will introduce this as much as possible as we go along by example, along with the mathematical terms that we wrote above.</p>
<p id="p-82">In order to do this we first need to introduce some notation which comes from the language of set theory.</p></section></section></div></main>
